## Read a String statement from the command line
   First off all you have take the str1 is the temparory variable.
   The str1 is the input we have to give the input manually with the help of copmmand line interface.
   After that you have to print the output.
     print(str1) example:"this is harish"
     
## Findout total number of characters present in the statement.  
   Initially you take the count=0
   Applying the for loop for the above mentioned given input string that is str1=input("enter the string")
   If the condition is satisfied we increment the count value by 1
   print the total charcaters by using the statement print("toatal no.of characters" ,count)

## Find out total number of duplicate Characters in the statement
    By using conditional statements we can find out the Duplicate Characters in given string.
    Initailly take an empty dictionar d={}
    count=0
    Applying for loop on the given input string
    if count(i)>0 we can add the chacaters to the empty dictionary.
    After that print the output.
    
## Find out total number of words present in the statement
     Initially taking the word_list as a temporary variable we can split the in  string as empty space.
     after that word_count is an another tempoary variable which is used to find the len of the word_list.
     Finally print the output of toatl number of the word present in the string.
     
## Find out total number of duplicate words in the statement
   Initially Words will be take a temporary variable and split the entire string.
   Take empty dictionary 
   Applying for for the words.
   Applying if condition for the temparary variable words.
   d[words]=1 is the key of the dictinary.
   else:
      d[word]=word+1 it is the value of dictionary.
   Finally got the output   
   
   ## Reverse the characters present in the statement
       IN this operation i am using slicing methos to reverse te entire characters in the given string.

  ##  Reverse the words present in the statement.
     I am taking data as an variable that is equal to str1.
     The str1 is splited into the empty space.
     Taking reversd_word as an temproary variable as empty string.
     applying for loop on the goiven data.
     Applying slice opertion on the given input string.
     After that increment the value of reversed_words by 1.
     Finally to print the output of the reversed?_words.

  ## to find out the new statement from the revesed word.
     Taken the new_statements is the varaible  that is equal to the revesed_words.
     I can store the output of the revesed_words as the new_statements.
     print(new_statemenets)

  ##  Fianl statements
      To get the final statement from the new  statement the value will be stoared in to the new _statememnts.
      print("final statements")

      Finally got the output "tra"
